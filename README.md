# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

## Scope, Goals and Description
Welcome to my 2nd Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors game! 

This is a player vs computer game where, following the rules of the game, the user and computer can score points up to 10, before one or the other wins that round. 

This game is designed to be played by someone who wants to play a game but doesn't have the time to play something complex. Perhaps on a mobile phone when travelling. It is also ideal for a younger audience This game is at a simple enough complexity that it can be played and enjoyed by anyone, as it is everyday by children everywhere.

The goal of this website, beyond testing my Javascript abilities, is to make a well-tested and fully functioning basic game that combines functionality with clean design and colours.

## Final Thoughts

This project was a real challange for me as this was the first time I used javascript. At some point I started to believe that this might not be something for me, I am happy I didn't give up and continue to do reasearch and learn and finish the project.
